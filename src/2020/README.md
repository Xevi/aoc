## How to run

Each day might have an input file in th <year>/inputs/day_n_input.txt. This is usually loaded automatically when running the main function associated with the given day.

To run the challenge of day 1 on the current year you would need for example to:

```sh
./run.sh day1
```

In case you want to run challenges from previous years you could specify the given year through second parameter of the run script as:

```sh
./run.sh day1 2020
```
